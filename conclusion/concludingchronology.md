# Concluding Chronology

A basic chronology will be provided that is consistent with astronomical dating results.  These results will be taken
as true.  One will be permitted to construct alternate chronologies to test against this basic chronology.
If the tests fail then advisories will be presented to answer objections to including those events in a chronology.
