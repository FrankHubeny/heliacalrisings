# Preface

## Overview

The purpose of this book is to justify accepting the absolute dating of two events
in ancient Egypt, 
1872 BC as the seventh year of Pharaoh Sesostris III of the 12{sup}`th` Egyptian
Dynasty and 1450 BC as the ... of the 18{sup}`th` Dynasty.  What makes these dates
absolute is their association with the heliacal rising of Sirius. 

From these two absolute datings 
one could calculate the dates of many other events in the 12{sup}`th` and
18{sup}`th` dynasties.  From those derived dates Douglas Petrovich was able
to link the beginning of the Israelite Sojourn in Egypt to 1876 BC and the Exodus 
exactly 430 years later in 1446 BC. Since the Exodus occurred on the first
Passover, one can specify almost to the day when both events occurred.

With Petrovich's justification for the Sojourn being 430 years in Egypt, the Short Sojourn
of about 215 years would have to be rejected.  This leads to an acceptance of the Biblical chronology that
Henry B. Smith, Jr and Jeremy Sexton have presented over the Ussher chronology that is
used in some Church traditions.  Both chronologies are biblical in the sense that they
rely on manuscript traditions of Genesis and Exodus. However, they can't both be
what the original autograph, now lost, contained.

## Justification

While I could accept the above ANE chronology as a commitment, I realized I couldn't 
justify it especially as people began doubting
the reliability of the astronomical dating when used to interpret 
what was written in ancient texts.  Being neither an astronomer nor an archeologist
I do not trust my own assessments of the value of the evidence provided.  However,
being a mathematician I am quite capable of checking the calculations that such evidence relies upon
organizing it as 
a logician might want to see it presented.  

In particular I am writing for the following kind of reader.

I expect the reader to be not interested in any say-so or assertion I might offer
no matter how mellodious the literary style. He wants a justification to quickly follow.
To meet that need, every number coming from a calculation comes with that calculation
which the reader can himself execute.  Every item that needs further explanation than
is relevant for this book has a link to a, preferably open access, document that is readily available.
I don't expect this reader to have access to an academic library nor to have ever visited the Near East.  I expect
the reader to be even more skeptical than I am.  So I have gone into details relevant to the results
I want to argue for.  I expect the reader to want to talk back.  The GitHub site provides a
place where he can raise and issue or post thoughts.  

## New Results

In the process of presenting this justification, I realized that the decan stars, those
36 stars with own heliacal risings coming ten days apart were not included in the initial calculations
of the absolute dates.  I also realized there were margins of errors that might
be tightened given that today we have more accurate astronomical
data from space and terrestrial telescopes and more powerful programming tools to manipulate this data.  

This led to a published improvement on the margin of error of those absolute dates
with stronger evidence that heliacal risings can confidently date the events mentioned in the ancient texts.
