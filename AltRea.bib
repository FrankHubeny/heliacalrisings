	abstract = {Thomas Forsyth Torrance  (30 August 1913 – 2 December 2007), commonly referred to as T. F. Torrance, was a Scottish Protestant theologian and minister. Torrance served for 27 years as professor of Christian dogmatics at New College, in the University of Edinburgh. He is best known for his pioneering work in the study of science and theology, but he is equally respected for his work in systematic theology. While he wrote many books and articles advancing his own study of theology, he also edited the translation of several hundred theological writings into English from other languages, including the English translation of the thirteen-volume, six-million-word Church Dogmatics of Swiss theologian Karl Barth, as well as John Calvin's New Testament Commentaries. He was a member of the famed Torrance family of theologians.
Torrance has been acknowledged as one of the most significant English-speaking theologians of the 20th century. In 1978, he received the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion. Torrance remained a dedicated churchman throughout his life, serving as an ordained minister in the Church of Scotland. He was instrumental in the development of the historic agreement between the Reformed and Eastern Orthodox churches on the doctrine of the Trinity when a joint statement of agreement on that doctrine was issued between the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and the Orthodox Church on 13 March 1991. He retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1979, but continued to lecture and to publish extensively. Several influential books on the Trinity were published after his retirement; The Trinitarian Faith: The Evangelical Theology of the Ancient Catholic Church (1988), Trinitarian Perspectives: Toward Doctrinal Agreement (1994) and The Christian Doctrine of God, One Being Three Persons (1996).},

	abstract = {The Christian doctrine of the Trinity (Latin: Trinitas, lit. 'triad', from Latin: trinus 'threefold') is the central dogma concerning the nature of God in most Christian churches, which defines one God existing in three coequal, coeternal, consubstantial divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons sharing one homoousion (essence) "each is God, complete and whole." As the Fourth Lateran Council declared, it is the Father who begets, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds. In this context, the three persons define who God is, while the one essence defines what God is. This expresses at once their distinction and their indissoluble unity. Thus, the entire process of creation and grace is viewed as a single shared action of the three divine persons, in which each person manifests the attributes unique to them in the Trinity, thereby proving that everything comes "from the Father," "through the Son," and "in the Holy Spirit."This doctrine is called Trinitarianism and its adherents are called Trinitarians, while its opponents are called antitrinitarians or nontrinitarians. Christian nontrinitarian positions include Unitarianism, Binitarianism and Modalism.
While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas. The doctrine of the Trinity was first formulated among the early Christians and fathers of the Church as they attempted to understand the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions.Though the Trinity is mainly a Christian concept, Judaism has had parallel views, especially among writings from the kabbalah tradition.},

	abstract = {Identity is often said to be a relation each thing bears to itself andto no other thing (e.g., Zalabardo 2000). This characterization isclearly circular (“no other thing”) andparadoxical too, unless the notion of “each thing” isqualified. More satisfactory (though partial) characterizations areavailable and the idea that such a relation of absolute identityexists is commonplace. Some, however, deny that a relation of absoluteidentity exists. Identity, they say, is relative: It is possible forobjects xxx and yyy to be the same FFF and yet not thesame GGG (where FFF and GGG are predicates representing kinds ofthings—apples, ships, passengers—rather than merelyproperties of things—colors, shapes). In such a case“same” cannot mean absolute identity. For example, thesame person might be two different passengers, since one person may becounted twice as a passenger. If to say that xxx and yyy are thesame person is to say that xxx and yyy are persons and are(absolutely) identical, and to say that xxx and yyy are differentpassengers is to say that xxx and yyy are passengers and are(absolutely) distinct, we have a contradiction. Others maintain thatwhile there are such cases of “relative identity”, thereis also such a thing as absolute identity. According to this view,identity comes in two forms: trivial or absolute and nontrivial orrelative (Gupta 1980). These maverick views present a seriouschallenge to the received, absolutist doctrine of identity. In thefirst place, cases such as the passenger/person case are moredifficult to dismiss than might be supposed (but see below, §3).Secondly, the standard view of identity is troubled by many persistentpuzzles and problems, some of recent and some of ancient origin. Therelative identity alternative sheds considerable light on theseproblems even if it does not promise a resolution of them all.},

I maintain that the justification for this response to the problem of evil does not depend on the availability of a persuasive argument for the existence of God. I will focus on one category of animal suffering: the gratuitous suffering of unseen animals. For reasons that will become clear, I think that this category of evil is the most difficult for the rational theist to explain.

On this understanding, Christ is derivatively, rather than fundamentally, located in the consecrated bread and wine, such that Christ is present to the believer through the consecrated bread and wine, thereby making available to the believer a second-person experience of Christ, where the consecrated bread and wine are the way in which she shares attention with him. The consecrated bread and wine are then, in a sense, icons of Christ.},

It can be thought of as the law of excluded middle written in a form that involves only one sort of connective, namely implication.
In propositional calculus, Peirce's law says that ((P→Q)→P)→P.  Written out, this means that P must be true if there is a proposition Q such that the truth of P follows from the truth of "if P then Q".
Peirce's law does not hold in intuitionistic logic or intermediate logics and cannot be deduced from the deduction theorem alone.
Under the Curry–Howard isomorphism, Peirce's law is the type of continuation operators, e.g. call/cc in Scheme.},

Specifically, the class of expressions for which the theorem holds is that generated by rational numbers, the number π, the number ln 2, the variable x, the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, composition, and the sin, exp, and abs functions.
For some classes of expressions (generated by other primitives than in Richardson's theorem), there exist algorithms that can determine whether an expression is zero.},

	abstract = {In metaphysics, nominalism is the view that universals and abstract objects do not actually exist other than being merely names or labels. There are at least two main versions of nominalism. One version denies the existence of universals – things that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things (e.g., strength, humanity). The other version specifically denies the existence of abstract objects – objects that do not exist in space and time.
Most nominalists have held that only physical particulars in space and time are real, and that universals exist only post res, that is, subsequent to particular things. However, some versions of nominalism hold that some particulars are abstract entities (e.g., numbers), while others are concrete entities – entities that do exist in space and time (e.g., pillars, snakes, and bananas).
Nominalism is primarily a position on the problem of universals.  It is opposed to realist philosophies, such as Platonic realism, which assert that universals do exist over and above particulars, and to the hylomorphic substance theory of Aristotle, which asserts that universals are immanently real within them. However, the name "nominalism" emerged from debates in medieval philosophy with Roscellinus.
The term nominalism stems from the Latin nomen, "name". John Stuart Mill summarised nominalism in his apothegm "there is nothing general except names".
In philosophy of law, nominalism finds its application in what is called constitutional nominalism.},

Hartry Field argues that we can explain the utility of mathematics without assuming it true. Part of the argument is that good mathematics has a special feature ('conservativeness') that allows it to be applied to 'nominalistic' claims (roughly, those neutral to the existence of mathematical entities) in a way that generates nominalistic consequences more easily without generating any new ones. Field goes on to argue that we can axiomatize physical theories using nominalistic claims only, and that in fact this has advantages over the usual axiomatizations that are independent of nominalism. There has been much debate about the book since it first appeared.

This process provides a means to link the simplicity of the Metamath foundations to the intense automation efforts which have borne fruit in HOL Light, allowing the production of complete Metamath proofs of theorems in HOL Light, while also proving that HOL Light is consistent, relative to Metamath's ZFC axiomatization.},

Platonism isthe view that (a) there exist abstract mathematical objects (i.e.,nonspatiotemporal mathematical objects), and (b) our mathematicalsentences and theories provide true descriptions of such objects. So,for instance, on the platonist view, the sentence ‘3 isprime’ provides a straightforward description of a certainobject—namely, the number 3—in much the same way that thesentence ‘Mars is red’ provides a description of Mars. Butwhereas Mars is a physical object, the number 3 is (according toplatonism) an abstract object. And abstract objects,platonists tell us, are wholly nonphysical, nonmental, nonspatial,nontemporal, and noncausal. Thus, on this view, the number 3 existsindependently of us and our thinking, but it does not exist in spaceor time, it is not a physical or mental object, and it does not enterinto causal relations with other objects.

However, despite its name, “Modal Fictionalism”in its usual manifestations is not primarily fictionalism about claimsof necessity and possibility, but rather a fictionalist approach toclaims about possible worlds. (For instance, modal fictionalism is notnormally fictionalist about the claim that “it is possible thatthere be a species of tail-less kangaroo”, but rather about theclaim that “there is a possible world in which there is aspecies of tail-less kangaroo”.) The practice of taking possibleworlds to be merely convenient fictions, or of treating talk aboutpossible worlds as being useful without being literally correct, isquite common in philosophical circles. It is only recently, however,that philosophers have seriously examined the implications of takingpossible worlds to be merely fictional objects, like Sherlock Holmesor a frictionless surface.},

	abstract = {Jason Lisle has formulated a model that purports to solve the light travel time problem (LTTP). The model is based on the Reichenbach ε formalism of specifying remote simultaneity by a coordinate convention (Reichenbach 1958, 127). The convention is directly based on the assumption that the one-way speed of light cannot be measured, since remote clocks cannot be synchronized. This conventionalist approach apparently allows one to alter the one-way speed of light such that incoming light to an observer can be made arbitrarily large by a suitable choice of the ε parameter. We show herein that such is not the case. The ASC model explicitly assumes the mathematical structure of Minkowski space and the foundations of special relativity (SR). Minkowski space presupposes an isotropic physical speed of light. The assumption of Minkowski space, as correctly embraced by Lisle, is incompatible with the conclusions of ASC which purports that the incoming speed of light can be made arbitrarily large.},

	abstract = {We present a young earth creationist (YEC) model of creation that is consistent with distant light from distant objects in the cosmos. We discuss the reality of time from theological/philosophical foundations. This results in the rejection of the idealist viewpoint of relativity and the recognition of the reality of the flow of time and the existence of a single cosmological “now.” We begin the construction of the YEC cosmology with an examination of the “chronological enigmas” of the inhomogeneous solutions of the Einstein field equations (EFE) of General Relativity (GR). For this analysis we construct an inhomogeneous model by way of the topological method of constructing solutions of the EFE. The topological method uses the local (tensorial) feature of solutions of the EFE that imply that if (M , g) is a solution then removing any closed subset X of M is also a solution on the manifold with M=A M − X and the restriction gA = g MA . Also, if (M A, gA ) and (MB, gB ) are solutions of the EFE in disjoint regions then the “stitching” together of (M A, gA ) and (MB, gB ) with continuous boundary conditions is also a solution. From this we show conceptually how an approximate “crude” model with a young earth neighborhood and an older remote universe can be constructed. This approximate “crude” model suffers from having abrupt boundaries. This model is an example of a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous space-time. We discuss the class of exact spherically symmetric inhomogeneous universes represented by the Lemaître-Tolman (L-T) class of exact solutions of the EFE. A more realistic model refines this technique by excising a past subset with an asymptotically null spacelike surface from the Friedmann-LemaîtreRobertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology. We build the model from the closed FLRW solution by selecting a spacelike hyperboloidal surface as the initial surface at the beginning of the first day of creation. This surface induces, by way of embedding into FLRW space-time, an isotropic but radially inhomogeneous matter density consistent with the full FLRW space-time. The resulting space-time is a subset of the usual FLRW space-time and thus preserves the FLRW causal structure and the observational predictions such as the Hubble law. We show that the initial spacelike surface evolves in a consistent manner and that light from the distant “ancient” galaxies arrives at the earth within the creation week and thereafter. All properties of light arriving from distant galaxies retain the same features as those of the FLRW space-time. This follows from the fact that the solution presented is an open subset of the FLRW space-time so that all differential properties and analysis that applies to FLRW also applies to our solution. Qualitatively these models solve the distant star light problem and from a theological point of view, in which God advances the (cosmic) time of the spacelike hypersurfaces at a non-uniform rate during the miraculous creation week, solve the distant light problem. We conclude by briefly discussing possible objections of some of our key assumptions and showing that a relativist cannot consistently object to our assumptions based on the merely operationalist point of view that an absolute spacelike “now” cannot be empirically determined.},

Assuming that the functioning of the mind is based in the physical brain, evidence from the way that the mind apprehends the flow of time prefers this evolving time model over those where there is no flow of time.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2405.18485},
	abstract = {The discovery by JWST of an abundance of luminous galaxies in the very early Universe suggests that galaxies developed rapidly, in apparent tension with many standard models. However, most of these galaxies lack spectroscopic confirmation, so their distances and properties are uncertain. We present JADES JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopic confirmation of two luminous galaxies at redshifts of \$z=14.32{\textasciicircum}\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.20\}\$ and \$z=13.90{\textbackslash}pm0.17\$. The spectra reveal ultraviolet continua with prominent Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ breaks but no detected emission lines. This discovery proves that luminous galaxies were already in place 300 million years after the Big Bang and are more common than what was expected before JWST. The most distant of the two galaxies is unexpectedly luminous (M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm uv\}=-20.81{\textbackslash}pm0.16\$) and is spatially resolved with a radius of 260 parsecs. Considering also the steep ultraviolet slope of the second galaxy (\${\textbackslash}beta=-2.71{\textbackslash}pm0.19\$), we conclude that both are dominated by stellar continuum emission, showing that the excess of luminous galaxies in the early Universe cannot be entirely explained by accretion onto black holes. Galaxy formation models will need to address the existence of such large and luminous galaxies so early in cosmic history.},

	abstract = {The BioLogos Foundation has published a popular-level article by old-earth geologists Gregg Davidson and Ken Wolgemuth presenting arguments for an old earth. One such argument involves counts of sedimentary laminations (“varves”) within the floor of Japan’s Lake Suigetsu. Their article claims that the very large number of Lake Suigetsu varve counts is strong evidence for an old earth. Creation scientists would argue that most of the lamination couplets are not true annual events. In fact, a plausible explanation for the couplets was presented in the young-earth creationist literature one year prior to Davidson and Wolgemuth’s article. Davidson and Wolgemuth, however, present a new “spin” on the argument: they claim that the correlation between these “varve” counts and radiocarbon dates (as well as tree-ring counts), proves that the Lake Suigetsu varves are true annual events, thus presenting an unanswerable argument for an old earth. However, careful examination of the papers they cite shows that this apparent agreement is the result of the typical uniformitarian circular reasoning. Furthermore, Davidson and Wolgemuth made numerous errors in their article (even within their own uniformitarian framework) which cause one to question whether they carefully read all of the technical papers they cited. Furthermore, they seem to misunderstand the recent results of the RATE research project that showed strong evidence of ubiquitous in situ radiocarbon within fossil specimens that should be radiocarbon “dead” by uniformitarian reckoning. Such results pose a serious challenge to uniformitarian assumptions underlying conventional radiocarbon age-dating methods.},

Analogue models of (and for) gravity have a long and distinguished history dating back to the earliest years of general relativity. In this review article we will discuss the history, aims, results, and future prospects for the various analogue models. We start the discussion by presenting a particularly simple example of an analogue model, before exploring the rich history and complex tapestry of models discussed in the literature. The last decade in particular has seen a remarkable and sustained development of analogue gravity ideas, leading to some hundreds of published articles, a workshop, two books, and this review article. Future prospects for the analogue gravity programme also look promising, both on the experimental front (where technology is rapidly advancing) and on the theoretical front (where variants of analogue models can be used as a springboard for radical attacks on the problem of quantum gravity).},

Additionally, astronomers have found 6 white dwarfs (stars that have exhausted all fusible hydrogen), 21 brown dwarfs, as well as 1 sub-brown dwarf, WISE 0855−0714 (possibly a rogue planet). The closest system is Alpha Centauri, with Proxima Centauri as the closest star in that system, at 4.2465 light-years from Earth. The brightest, most massive and most luminous object among those 131 is Sirius A, which is also the brightest star in Earth's night sky; its white dwarf companion Sirius B is the hottest object among them. The largest object within the 20 light-years is Procyon.
The Solar System, and the other stars/dwarfs listed here, are currently moving within (or near) the Local Interstellar Cloud, roughly 30 light-years (9.2 pc) across. The Local Interstellar Cloud is, in turn, contained inside the Local Bubble, a cavity in the interstellar medium about 300 light-years (92.0 pc) across.  It contains Ursa Major and the Hyades star cluster, among others. The Local Bubble also contains the neighboring G-Cloud, which contains the stars Alpha Centauri and Altair. In the galactic context, the Local Bubble is a small part of the Orion Arm, which contains most stars that we can see without a telescope. The Orion Arm is one of the spiral arms of our Milky Way galaxy.},

	abstract = {In 1905 Einstein developed his theory of special relativity.  It was an explanation of how speed affects mass, time and space.  It included a way for the speed of light to define the relationship between energy and matter.  In it, he defined that the speed of light was constant.  What many people may not be aware of is that Einstein did not hold this view for long and would start to develop a theory which would allow for a variable speed of light.

	abstract = {It is a little known fact that while he was developing his theory of general relativity, Einstein's initial idea was a variable speed of light theory. Indeed space-time curvature can be mimicked by a speed of light \$c(r)\$ that depends on the distribution of masses. Einstein's 1911 theory was considerably improved by Robert Dicke in 1957, but only recently has the equivalence of the variable speed of light approach to the conventional formalism been demonstrated (Broekaert, 2008). Using Green's functions, we show that Einstein's 1911 idea can be expressed in an analytic form, similar to the Poisson equation. Using heuristic arguments, we derive a simple formula that directly relates curvature \$w\$ to the local speed of light, \$w= -c{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{c{\textasciicircum}2\}\$. In contrast to the conventional formulation, this allows for a Machian interpretation of general relativity and the gravitational constant \$G\$. Gravity, though described by local equations, has its origin in all other masses in the universe.},

	abstract = {Based on magnitudes and Petrosian radii from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, data release 7) at low redhift (z {\textless}0.2), we developed a test of galaxy-size evolution. For this first quantitative size analysis using SDSS data, several possible sources of systematic errors had to be considered. The Malmquist bias is excluded by volume-limited samples. A correction for seeing has been developed and applied. We compare different methods to perform the K-correction, and avoid selection effects due to different filters. It is found that apparent average galaxy size slightly decreases with redshift z, corresponding to a growth in time. The effect is smaller for a lower H0, and at the same time less pronounced at higher redshifts, but persists in both cases. Although there is no systematic variation with galaxy luminosity, we took into account the recently discovered luminosity evolution with redshift. Assuming this effect of unknown origin to be real, we find a slight increase of galaxy size with z. The relative change of average size with z usually amounts to less than one half of the respective increase of wavelengths due to the cosmological redshift, making a cosmological interpretation difficult. While the effect shows clear statistical significance, unknown systematics cannot be excluded. In any case, the enigmatic observations of size and luminosity evolution need to be analysed together. To facilitate further investigations, a complete Mathematica code and instructions for data download are provided.},

We study Dirac's article on the large number hypothesis (1938), Sciama's proposal of realizing Mach's principle (1953), and Dicke's considerations (1957) on a flat-space representation of general relativity with a variable speed of light (VSL). Dicke's tentative theory can be formulated in a way which is compatible with Sciama's hypothesis on the gravitational constant G. Additionally, such a cosmological model is shown to satisfy Dirac's second `large number' hypothesis on the total number of particles in the universe being proportional to the square of the epoch. In the same context, Dirac's first hypothesis on an epoch-dependent G-contrary to his prediction- does not necessarily produce a visible time dependence of G. While Dicke's proposalreproduces the classical tests of GR in first approximation, the cosmological redshift is described by a shortening of measuring rods rather than an expansion of space. Since the temporal evolution of the horizon R is governed by {\textbackslash}dot R(t) =c(t), the flatness and horizon problems do not arise in the common form.},

A corresponding hypothesis of Sciama (1953) on the gravitational constant, c{\textasciicircum}2/G = {\textbackslash}sum m\_i/r\_i, is linked to Dicke's (1957) proposal of an electromagnetic origin of gravitation, a precursor of scalar-tensor-theories. In this an equivalent description in terms of a variable speed of light (VSL) is given, and the agreement with the four classical tests of general relativity is shown. Moreover, VSL opens the possibility to write the total energy of a particle as E=mc{\textasciicircum}2; this necessarily leads to the proportionality of inertial and gravitating mass, the equivalence principle. Furthermore, a formula for c depending on the mass distribution is given that reproduces Newton's law of gravitation. This mass distribution allows to calculate a slightly variable term that corresponds to the `constant' G. The present proposal may also supply an alternative explanation to the flatness problem and the horizon problem in cosmology.},

	abstract = {According to Mach's principle inertia has its reason in the presence of all masses in the universe. Despite there is a lot of sympathy for this plausible idea, only a few quantitative frameworks have been proposed to test it. In this paper a tentative theory is given which is based on Mach's critisism on Newton's rotating bucket. Taking this criticism seriously, one is led to the hypothesis that the rotation of our galaxy is the reason for gravitation. Concretely, a functional dependence of the gravitational constant on the size, mass and angular momentum of the milky way is proposed that leads to a spatial, but not to a temporal variation of G. Since Newton's inverse-square law is modified, flat rotation curves of galaxies can be explained that usually need the postulate of dark matter. While the consequences for stellar evolution are discussed briefly, a couple of further observational coincidences are noted and possible experimental tests are proposed.},

	abstract = {A circular twist disclination is a nontrivial example of a defect in an elastic continuum that causes large deformations. The minimal potential energy and the corresponding displacement field is calculated by solving the Euler-Lagrange-equations. The nonlinear incompressibility constraint is rigorously taken into account. By using an appropriate curvilinear coordinate system a finer resolution in the regions of large deformations is obtained and the dimension of the arising nonlinear PDE's is reduced to two. The extensive algebraic calculations that arise are done by a computer algebra system (CAS). The PDE's are then solved by a difference scheme using the Newton-Raphson algorithm of successive approximations for multidimensional equations. Additional features for global convergence are implemented. To obtain basic states that are sufficiently close to the solution, a one dimensional linearized version of the equation is solved with a numerical computation that reproduces the analytical results of Huang and Mura (1970). With this method, rigorous solutions of the nonlinear equations without any additional simplifications can be obtained. The numerical results show a contraction of the singularity line which corresponds to the well-known Poynting effect in nonlinear elasticity. This combination of analytical and numerical computations proves to be a versatile method to solve nonlinear boundary value problems in complicated geometries.},

In the first section, some comments on old unresolved problems in theoretical physics are collected. In the following, I shall explain what relation exists between Feynman graphs and the teleparallel theory of Einstein and Cartan in the late 1920s, and the relation of both to the theories of the incompressible aether around 1840. Reviewing these developments, we will have a look at the continuum theory of dislocations developed by Kroener in the 1950s and some techniques of differential geometry and topology relevant for a modern description of defects in continous media. I will then illustrate some basic concepts of nonlinear continuum mechanics and discuss applications to the above theories. By doing so, I hope to attract attention to the possible relevance of these facts for `fundamental' physics.},

	abstract = {In the present paper a geometrization of electrodynamics is proposed which makes use of a generalization of Riemannian geometry considered already by Einstein and Cartan in the 20ies. Cartan's differential forms description of a teleparallel space-time with torsion is modified by introducing distortion 1-forms which correspond to the distortion tensor in dislocation theory. Under the condition of teleparallelism, the antisymmetrized part of the distorsion 1-form approximates the electromagnetic field, whereas the antisymmetrized part of torsion contributes to the electromagnetic current. Cartan's structure equations, the Bianchi identities, Maxwell's equations and the continuity equation are thus linked in a most simple way. After these purely geometric considerations a physical interpretation, using analogies to the theory of defects in ordered media, is given. A simple defect, which is neither a dislocation nor disclination proper, appears as source of the electromagnetic field. Since this defect is rotational rather than translational, there seems to be no contradiction to Noether's theorem as in other theories relating torsion to electromagnetism. Then,congruences of defect properties and quantum behaviour that arise are discussed, supporting the hypothesis that elementary particles are topological defects of space-time. In agreement with the differential geometry results, a dimensional analysis indicates that the physical unit (lenght){\textasciicircum}2 rather than As is the appropriate unit of the electric charge.},

The ratios constitute very large, dimensionless numbers: some 40 orders of magnitude in the present cosmological epoch. According to Dirac's hypothesis, the apparent similarity of these ratios might not be a mere coincidence but instead could imply a cosmology with these unusual features:

The strength of gravity, as represented by the gravitational constant, is inversely proportional to the age of the universe: 
  
    
      
        G
        ∝
        1

        t
        
      
    
    \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle G{\textbackslash}propto 1/t{\textbackslash},\}
  

The mass of the universe is proportional to the square of the universe's age: 
  
    
      
        M
        ∝

While this concept is exhibited by general relativity, which describes the dynamics of spacetime, one should not expect it to hold in less fundamental theories.

A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textless} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

	abstract = {Predictions of apocalyptic events that would result in the extinction of humanity, a collapse of civilization, or the destruction of the planet have been made since at least the early Common Era. Most predictions are related to Abrahamic religions, often standing for or similar to the eschatological events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the rapture, the Great Tribulation, the Last Judgment, and the Second Coming of Christ. Many religious-related end-time events are predicted to occur within the lifetime of the person making the prediction, who often quote the Bible, and in particular the New Testament, as either the primary or exclusive source for the predictions. This often takes the form of mathematical calculations, such as trying to calculate the point where it will have been 6000 years since the supposed creation of the Earth by the Abrahamic God, which according to the Talmud marks the deadline for the Messiah to appear. Predictions of the end from natural events have also been theorised by various scientists and scientific groups. While these disasters are generally accepted within the scientific community as plausible "end of the world" scenarios, the events and phenomena are not expected to occur for hundreds of thousands or even billions of years from now.
Little research has been done into why people make apocalyptic predictions. Historically, it has been done for reasons such as diverting attention from actual crises like poverty and war, pushing political agendas, and promoting hatred of certain groups; antisemitism was a popular theme of Christian apocalyptic predictions in medieval times, while French and Lutheran depictions of the apocalypse were known to feature English and Catholic antagonists respectively. According to psychologists, possible explanations for why people believe in modern apocalyptic predictions include mentally reducing the actual danger in the world to a single and definable source, an innate human fascination with fear, personality traits of paranoia and powerlessness and a modern romanticism involved with end-times due to its portrayal in contemporary fiction. The prevalence of Abrahamic religions throughout modern history is said to have created a culture which encourages the embracement of a future that will be drastically different from the present. Such a culture is credited with the rise in popularity of predictions that are more secular in nature, such as the 2012 phenomenon, while maintaining the centuries-old theme that a powerful force will bring the end of humanity.
Polls conducted in 2012 across 20 countries found over 14\% of people believe the world will end in their lifetime, with percentages ranging from 6\% of people in France to 22\% in the US and Turkey. Belief in the apocalypse is observed to be most prevalent in people with lower rates of education, lower household incomes, and those under the age of 35. In the UK in 2015, 23\% of the general public believed the apocalypse was likely to occur in their lifetime, compared to 10\% of experts from the Global Challenges Foundation. The general public believed the likeliest cause would be nuclear war, while experts thought it would be artificial intelligence. Only 3\% of Britons thought the end would be caused by the Last Judgement, compared to 16\% of Americans. Between one and three percent of people from both countries said the apocalypse would be caused by zombies or alien invasion.},

	abstract = {The Messier objects are a set of 110 astronomical objects catalogued by the French astronomer Charles Messier in his Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles (Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters). 
Because Messier was interested only in finding comets, he created a list of those non-comet objects that frustrated his hunt for them. This list, which Messier created in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain, is now known as the Messier catalogue. The Messier catalogue is one of the most famous lists of astronomical objects, and many objects on the list are still referenced by their Messier numbers. 
The catalogue includes most of the astronomical deep-sky objects that can be easily observed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere; many Messier objects are popular targets for amateur astronomers.
A preliminary version of the catalogue first appeared in 1774 in the Memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences for the year 1771.
The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45 objects, which were not numbered. Eighteen of the objects were discovered by Messier; the rest had been previously observed by other astronomers.
By 1780 the catalogue had increased to 70 objects. The final version of the catalogue containing 103 objects was published in 1781 in the Connaissance des Temps for the year 1784.
However, due to what was thought for a long time to be the incorrect addition of Messier 102, the total number remained 102. Other astronomers, using side notes in Messier's texts, eventually filled out the list up to 110 objects.
The catalogue consists of a diverse range of astronomical objects, from star clusters and nebulae to galaxies. For example, Messier 1 is a supernova remnant, known as the Crab Nebula, and the great spiral Andromeda Galaxy is M31. Further inclusions followed; the first addition came from Nicolas Camille Flammarion in 1921, who added Messier 104 after finding Messier's side note in his 1781 edition exemplar of the catalogue. M105 to M107 were added by Helen Sawyer Hogg in 1947, M108 and M109 by Owen Gingerich in 1960, and M110 by Kenneth Glyn Jones in 1967.},

	abstract = {High-dimensional biphoton states are promising resources for quantum applications, ranging from high-dimensional quantum communications to quantum imaging. A pivotal task is fully characterizing these states, which is generally time-consuming and not scalable when projective measurement approaches are adopted; however, new advances in coincidence imaging technologies allow for overcoming these limitations by parallelizing multiple measurements. Here we introduce biphoton digital holography, in analogy to off-axis digital holography, where coincidence imaging of the superposition of an unknown state with a reference state is used to perform quantum state tomography. We apply this approach to single photons emitted by spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal when the pump photons possess various quantum states. The proposed reconstruction technique allows for a more efficient (three orders of magnitude faster) and reliable (an average fidelity of 87\%) characterization of states in arbitrary spatial modes bases, compared with previously performed experiments. Multiphoton digital holography may pave the route toward efficient and accurate computational ghost imaging and high-dimensional quantum information processing.},

With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\% to 15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q\_0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega\_M+Omega\_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega\_Lambda=0 and q\_0 {\textgreater} 0.},

Most of the baryons today are still in the form of ionized gas, which contributes a mean density uncertain by a factor of about four. Stars and their remnants are a relatively minor component, comprising for our best-guess plasma density only about 17\% of the baryons, while populations contributing most of the blue starlight comprise less than 5\%. The formation of galaxies and of stars within them appears to be a globally inefficient process. The sum over our budget, expressed as a fraction of the critical Einstein-de Sitter density, is in the range \$0.007{\textbackslash}lsim{\textbackslash}Omega\_B{\textbackslash}lsim 0.041\$, with a best guess \${\textbackslash}Omega\_B{\textbackslash}sim 0.021\$ (at Hubble constant 70 km/s/Mpc). The central value agrees with the prediction from the theory of light element production and with measures of the density of intergalactic plasma at redshift \$z{\textbackslash}sim 3\$. This apparent concordance suggests we may be close to a complete survey of the major states of the baryons.},

	abstract = {The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is taken today as reflecting the thermodynamical state of the universe at these early cosmic times. Based on this assumption and standard cosmological principles meanwhile many fundamental cosmological facts have been deduced from the CMB state which, however, to some surprise reveal that the universe should be dominated by dark energy and dark matter, while for its energy content the usual baryonic matter is nearly negligible. Thus the question which we want to raise in this article is, whether this standard interpretation of the CMB phenomenon is solid and unequivocal enough to support the standard cosmological claims. We shall show, however, that in many details the standard explanation is not straightforward, but allows for important alternatives which seriously should be looked at. Especially arguments for a vanishing cosmic curvature (k = 0) are shown to be weak, and, contrary to the usual claim, the light distance to the recombination horizon is in fact strongly model-biassed. We also show that the CMB dipole which is generally understood as a consequence of a peculiar motion by about 680 km/s with respect to rest system of the CMB can as well, and perhaps even better, be understood as indication of differerent cosmological expansion dynamics seen in an anisotropically expanding universe in different directions of the sky. We also discuss that the power amplitude (i.e. effective Planck temperature) in the dipolar CMB structure depends on wavelength even inverting the dipole maximum orientation in the Wien's branch. In addition unexpected properties of the lowest CMB multipoles could mean that we are at least partly seeing an unquantifyable foreground in the background. Only after its removal the CMB interpretation could at all then, but then on a completely new basis, become a subject of cosmological terms. At the end of this article we shall briefly discuss an alternative explanation of the CMB radiation which helps to better understand the mysterious cosmic photon-to-baryon ratio of about 109.},

It suggests that the highly visible adoption of astronomical records in historical scholarship in Enlightenment Europe by Nicolas Fréret and Voltaire was entangled with debates about Chinese chronology, translated by Jesuit missionaries. The article argues that the missionary Martino Martini's experience of the Manchu conquest of China was crucial in shaping his conception of history as a discipline. Political events that unfolded in seventeenth-century China had a marked effect on discussions about emergent world history in eighteenth-century Europe.},

In each of these categories, there is little concensus and a wide range of possible solutions; a precise Egyptian chronology is therefore not possible. The present survey of this evidence and the theories derived therefrom emphasizes that modern scholarship wrongly assumes a precision the Egyptians could not achieve, that it is incorrect to speak of astronomical observations made for other than purely local purposes, and that feast days, including the New Year, began on different days at different latitudes along the Nile Valley.},

	abstract = {The Westcar Papyrus (inventory-designation: P. Berlin 3033) is an ancient Egyptian text containing five stories about miracles performed by priests and magicians. In the papyrus text, each of these tales are told at the royal court of king Khufu (Cheops) (Fourth Dynasty, 26th century BCE) by his sons. The story in the papyrus usually is rendered in English as, "King Cheops and the Magicians" and "The Tale of King Cheops' Court". In German, into which the text of the Westcar Papyrus was first translated, it is rendered as Die Märchen des Papyrus Westcar ("the fairy tales of Papyrus Westcar").
The surviving material of the Westcar Papyrus consists of twelve columns written in hieratic script. Miriam Lichtheim dates the document to the Hyksos period (eighteenth to sixteenth century BC) and states that it is written in classical Middle Egyptian. Linguist and Egyptologist Verena Lepper thinks it is possible that the Westcar Papyrus was written during the Thirteenth Dynasty. The papyrus has been used by historians as a literary resource for reconstituting the history of the Fourth Dynasty.
The papyrus is now on display under low-light conditions in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin.},
