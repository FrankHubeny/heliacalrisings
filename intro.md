# Sothis: Stellar Dating of Ancient Events

**_This book is still under construction.  Most of the pages contain template data._**

This book presents various chronologies of the Ancient Near East and then of the world.  

Programmable tests are also presented to show the weaknesses of some of these chronologies.  

If the reader downloads the book or runs it interactively he can construct new chronologies to see how well
they pass the tests.  The reader may also be to add new tests to refine testing the chronologies.
