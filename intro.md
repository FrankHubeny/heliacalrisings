# Heliacal Risings

## Overview

This book covers the astronomical details of the heliacal risings of Sirius (Sothis) and the decan stars in
the Egyptian civil calendar from various places of observation.  It also examines the ancient texts
where such heliacal risings are mentioned to see if one can assign an absolute date to the events in those texts.

The conclusion of the book will be that heliacal risings are more reliable for establishing absolute dates
than has been previously believed.  Tighter margins of error will be presented along with arguments for a
specific observation place.
